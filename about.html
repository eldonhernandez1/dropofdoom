		<p>LEX LUTHOR’s corporation LexCorp is certainly up to no good.  LEX is bent on world domination, and he’s starting by destroying your sanity on this thrilling descent. This is the tallest and fastest drop tower on the planet - the ultimate free fall!</p>
		<p>Strap into your chair and settle in, because the ride to the top of the 415 foot tower will be the longest 90 seconds of your life. You’ll be hoisted up more than 40 stories in the air as the people below you grow further and further away. When you look down, all you’ll see are your feet dangling in the air and the sheer drop of 400 feet straight beneath you.</p>
		<p>LEX shares the same tower with his arch-enemy SUPERMAN: Escape from Krypton, and if you’re lucky, or unlucky depending on how you look at it, you might catch the SUPERMAN cars riding right next to you.</p>
		<p>Once you hit the top, you’ll get some friendly advice from the mastermind of this ride, LEX LUTHOR, but you might be too busy shaking in your boots to hear a word he says. Suddenly, without warning, it’s time to free fall, as you release and plummet straight down to the earth at a staggering 85 adrenaline-charged miles per hour, so fast you’ll barely have time to scream.</p>
		<p>On the way out check out the LexCorp weapons training facility – fun and carnival-style games to win prizes, and the Daily Planet gift shop so you can prove to your friends at home you had the nerve to take the steepest drop in Southern California.</p>
